# üîó URL Shortner

This project implements a URL shortener service using Django and PostgreSQL. It allows users to input a URL and receive a shortened version of it, which redirects to the original URL when accessed.

## üìã Features

- **URL Shortening**: Users can submit a URL to be shortened. The application generates a unique identifier, saves it along with the original URL, and provides a shortened URL to the user.
- **URL Redirection**: When a user accesses a shortened URL, the application redirects them to the original, longer URL.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL is used to store the original and shortened URLs, ensuring fast retrieval and management of data.

## üèÅ Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through setting up the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip
- Virtualenv (optional but recommended)
- PostgreSQL

### Setting Up a Virtual Environment
1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:Talantino/python-4-url-shortener.git
    ```

2. **Set up and activate a virtual environment:**

  Creating a virtual environment is recommended to keep dependencies required by different projects separate.

  - Install virtualenv if you haven't installed it yet:

      ```bash
      pip install virtualenv
      ```

  - Create a virtual environment in the project directory:

      ```bash
      virtualenv venv
      ```

  - Activate the virtual environment:

      - On Windows:

          ```bash
          venv\Scripts\activate
          ```

      - On Unix or MacOS:

          ```bash
          source venv/bin/activate
          ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

    With the virtual environment activated, install the project dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Configure the PostgreSQL database:**

    Ensure you have PostgreSQL installed and running. Create a database for this project and configure the database settings in your project's `settings.py` file.

5. **Perform database migrations:**

    Navigate to the `url-shortener` directory and apply migrations to set up your database schema:

    ```bash
    cd url-shortener
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

6. **Create a superuser:**

    Create a superuser for Django's admin panel with the following command:

    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

    Follow the prompts to set up the username, email, and password for the superuser.

7. **Run the project:**

    Start the Django development server:

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

    The project will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## üïπÔ∏è Usage

To shorten a URL, navigate to the home page and enter the URL in the form provided. Submitting the form will generate a shortened URL which redirects to the original URL when accessed.

For administrative tasks, such as viewing or deleting shortened URLs, access Django's admin panel at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin` using the superuser credentials you created.
